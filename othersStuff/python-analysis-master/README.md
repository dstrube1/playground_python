# Statistical Analysis with Python

## Getting Started

This workshop assumes a basic working knowlege of Python. If you are new, please take a look at the Introduction To Python and Intermediate Python workshops available on the [GT Library Data Visualization GitHub](https://github.com/GTLibraryDataVisualization).

#### 1. Install Python3 (3.7.X or latest release)
To check if you have Python3 installed in Terminal or Command Prompt run the command `python3 --version`. You should see a line similar to `Python 3.7.6`. If python is not installed, download and install it from one of the links below.

* [Python3 official release (Windows/ MacOS/ Linux)](https://www.python.org)
* [Anaconda (Windows/ MacOS/ Linux)](https://www.anaconda.com)
* [Homebrew (MacOS)](https://brew.sh)
* [APT (Linux)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-linux-python.html)

#### 2. Install Dependencies

If you are on your personal machine, before installing everything in `requirements.txt` I recommend installing and setting up [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) and [virtualenvwrapper](https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). It helps keeps your dependencies seperated by project leaving you with clean, exportable python environments.

Navigate to the repository directory in Terminal or Command Prompt and run `pip install -r requirements.txt`. This will install every package listed in `requirements.txt`

#### 3. Open the Jupter Notebook
1. Navigate to the repository directory in Terminal or Command Prompy and run `jupyter notebook`. This will boot up a local server and open a GUI Finder/Explorer at your current directory in your default web browser.
2. Open `Statistical Analysis with Python.ipynb`
